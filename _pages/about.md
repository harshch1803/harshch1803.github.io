I am a fourth-year Computer Science PhD Student at Northeastern University, where I am advised by [Alina Oprea](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/alina/). My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning, security, and privacy. Current research focuses on stress testing Large Language Models to understand and mitigate threats to participating users. Previously, I completed my Masters (via Research) from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) where I mainly worked in the area of privacy-preserving machine learning via Multi-Party Computation (MPC). 

Feel free to email me at {firstname}ch1803@gmail.com if you have exciting ideas you want to discuss!


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
