I am a second-year Computer Science PhD Student at Northeastern University, where I am advised by [Alina Oprea](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/). My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning, security, and privacy. My current research focuses on designing attacks on machine learning models to understand and consequently mitigate threats it may have on the safety of the participating users. My previous research contributions were mainly in the area of privacy-preserving machine learning via Multi-Party Computation (MPC). 

I completed my Masters from  [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) in 2020, under the supervision of [Arpita Patra](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/index.html). I spent  summer 2020 interning with the crypto group at IBM Research Bangalore,  where I was hosted by [Dhinakaran Vinayagamurthy](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-dvinaya1) and [Pankaj Dyama](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-pankajdayama). 


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
